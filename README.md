Welcome to the Social Journaling app! This application is designed to help users express themselves through journaling and sharing their thoughts in a secure and personalized environment. It is built on the T3 stack, powered by Next.js 13, and leverages ClerkJS for authentication, Prisma for the database, and TRPC for the API.

## Features

### Secure Authentication
ClerkJS handles the authentication process, ensuring robust user authentication, allowing seamless access to the app's features.

### Privacy Controls
Users can toggle their account to private, limiting access to their posts, and private details solely to their followers. This ensures user privacy and control over their shared content.

### Social Connectivity
Users can follow others and be followed, establishing a network where their posts are visible to followers. This allows for a personalized feed experience.
